## Installation
1. Windows user can double click on activation.bat file to install required package
2. Linux User type following command in commnand line
a) First create a virtual environment 
```bash
python3.7 -m virtualenv venv
```
b) Move to venv directory and activate environment
```bash
cd venv
. bin/activate
```
c) Clone this project 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pandeynandancse/neural_style_transfer_streamlit.git
```

d) Move into cloned directory
```bash
cd springer_book_downloader
```
e) Now install all requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Run
1. After successfull installation windows user can directly open this link : https://127.0.0.1:5000
2. After successful installation open type
```bash
streamlit run final.py
 ```
and then open link : https://127.0.0.1:5000

## To Do
1. Add More Architecture Options
2. Add another loss functions options
3. More flexibility to choose parameters
